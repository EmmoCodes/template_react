# Project Ordinary-Box (Frontend 👾)

**Frontend** part of the **POB**, a project inspired by the good old
Jokebox, but instead of having a lot of music, it should have a lot of apps.
I'm currently doing a bootcamp in FullStack (JavaScript), and as of this, I was struggling.
to find a long-term project to increase my coding skills.
So why not make the problem a part of the solution instead of finding
one good project, let's find multiple good projects? 🤪

## The Idea 💡

I was always fascinated by tech-related stuff that was fancy, flashy, and maybe even functional.
So I got myself a Raspberry Pi, joined a coding bootcamp, and combined all of that with my love of craftsmanship.
When the project takes shape, the hearth should be married to the body.
a vintage radio or something—it doesn't really matter what—some old tech
The program should have some kind of smart home dashboard, and from there, access
a bunch of apps; later, it should also have a database and a connection to a webapp.
But for now, let's just start... 🏁

## Features 🌟

_Planned for now:_
- **Old-vintage** body combined with some **cyberpunk** interface.
- Display current **weather** and indoor values
- Play **Musik**
- **Alarm** Clock
